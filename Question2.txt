How to set multiple remote repositories for the same project? Explain the
use case. you should have a working demo of it.
Ans: To get started we will first fork and clone the main repo so that we have
     our own version to work on and test things out before we submit changes
     to the main repo.Open the GitHub page of the repository that you want to
     work on and click on "Fork" in the top right corner. Select the account
     where you would like to fork to.Now that you have a local copy of your
     fork, "change directory" to the cloned directory.By default, cloning a
     repository will set the URL of that repository as the 'origin' remote.
     Let's confirm that by listing all configured remotes:git remote -v lists
     all configured remotes where git remote get-url origin shows the URL of
     the remote named 'origin'.
     Now we want to configure the 'main' repo, from which we forked, as the
    'upstream' remote.First, let's check if the name 'upstream' is available
     by getting the URL for 'upstream'To configure the upstream remote we will
     use the git remote add upstream https://main-repo-url.git command.
     To update the name of an existing remote use the command git remote
     set-url upstream https://new-url.git where 'upstream' is the name of the
     remote that you want to edit. To remove a remote completely use the
     command git remote remove upstream where 'upstream' is the name of the
     remote that you want to remove.Now, let's confirm that we have two 
     remotes configured one for our fork called 'origin' and one for the main
     repo called 'upstream'.
